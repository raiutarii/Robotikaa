Control of Mobile Robotics
Lab 3 - Navigation with Distance Sensors
Robot: GCTronic' e-puck
Language: Python

All tasks:
	print: 3 distance sensor values ( LEFT FRONT RIGHT)
	proportional control functions decide motor velocity
	tested with proportional gain value =>  KP = [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 5.0]




Task 1 - Motion with PID - Front Distance Sensor
	Given: desire stopping distance from wall =>    10 inches
	Movement: straight to wall, use PID to stop


Task 2 - Motion wwith PID - Side Distance Sensors
	Given: desire distance from the side walls =>  2.5 inches < desired < 5.5 inches


Task 3 - Wall following - corridor
	Given: desired distance from side walls => 2.5 inches < desired < 5.5 inches

Task 4 - Wall following - maze
	given: desired distance from side walls =>   2.5 inches M desired < 5.5 inches
